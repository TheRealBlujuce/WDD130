      <h2>Style Guide</h2>
  
      <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->
  
      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
  
      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
      <p>Palette URL:</p>
      <a href="https://coolors.co/e6f2f2-e2dbbe-f6c547-3d484f" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/e6f2f2-e2dbbe-f6c547-3d484f</a>

          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->

      </tbody></table>
  
      <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->
  
      <h3>Typography</h3>

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

        <h2>Home</h2>
          <p>
            The Home Page will simple. It will sort of have an about me section describing what I do with 
            the website and the kind of information they will be presented with. I will also add on personal 
            experience and provide information on how games are rated. There will not be images on the home screen, 
            since the home screen is just for navigation seeing how this is a blog website. Because of this, all 
            the real content will be in actual posts themselves. Because of this, navigation is tied to posts, and 
            not to a navigation bar. Rating will be determined using a star system where each star represents an age group. 
            1 star = 10+, 2 stars = 15+, and 3 stars = 17+. Each game reviewed will have specific sections of review: 
            Gameplay, Graphics, Music, and Potential Benefits. Gameplay will be about what you as the player or in this case, your child, 
            will be doing in the game. What is there to do? Is it too violent for a younger child? Are there things to do besides something violent? 
            Graphics will describe what the art-style is like, as well as special effects. Is there blood shows? if so, how much blood is shown? 
            Is it pure gore, or is it not significant enough to desensitise the child? Are the graphics cartoony or hyper-realistic? The Music 
            section will describe the music of the game. Some parents only let their children listen to certain types of music. So is the music 
            more calming and relaxing? Is it invigorating? Does it entice energy or relaxation based on the gameplay? And finally, the Potential Benefits 
            section will describe what it actually provides, skill-wise to a child (or adult even!). Does it promote problem-solving? does it 
            require that you work in a group? Do you need to prepare to meet certain expectations? Does it help with your hand-eye coordination? 
            Many people believe that video games make children out to be criminals, overly violent, and bad adults. However, it has been proven that 
            this is not the case. This section will also point out certain behaviors and emotions children may have while playing the game, and tips on how to help 
            the child process their emotions in a manner that will help them find joy in game, and out.

            Here I will give my rating and feedback on the game World of Warcraft and describe how it plays, and what kind of content there is to play through. I will be descriptive
            enough that parents will be able to make a wise decision if the game fits the standards they wish to instill in their children, providing a more accurate desicion to the question 
            "Should my child play this game or not?"
